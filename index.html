            <h2>For greatest love <br> My baby, Shan</h2>
            <p>Hi baby. I know it is kinda unbearable and confusing why I'm still making you this letter,
                 I'm sorry if I'm still hard headed as ever, but even if I know you're gone and far away from me,
                  I doubt that you'll ever read this letter but still, I just want you to know. I'm sooo grateful that I started this year together with you,
                   so I still wanna spend the last moments and remaining time of this year still with you. 
                   
                   <br> <br>Before this year ends,
                    I wanna say everything I wanted say to you, a sincere and heartful message to my greatest love who had been with me throughout all the things
                     and memories that we shared this year, with your love, your sweetness, your support, and your dedication in respecting our relationship to its fullest. 
                     
                     </p>
            <p>Thank you, Thank you, Thank you <br> Thank you so much for being who you are, you're the greatest girlfriend I could ever hoped for, and the for being my sole comfort throughout the year. Your kisses that never failed to melt my heart, your smile that made my day, the way we hold hands when sitting together, the hugs we made whenever things have been too much for us, the thigh thingy we usually do, the letters we have exchanged with each other, the conversations that never seemed to end, your angelic singing voice and the guitar covers I made for you, the valentine gifts, the jerseys we exchanged with each other, the babies we took care of, the short stroll around the campus, the flower ring we made for each other, the promises we made along the way, the memorable dates and places we've been to together, the</p>
            <p> I'm sorry if I haven't been the best, I genuinely love you, Shan. Happy Girlfriend's Day!!</p>
            <p>Forever yours,</p>
